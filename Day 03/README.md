*Lesson Objective* - Learn the importance of version control and the fundamentals of git and GitHub

- Go through the [version control slides](./slide_builds/version_control_1-export.pdf)
- Go through [my_first_repo_example_start](my_first_repo_example_start/README.md)
- Get them to do the first [Exercise](./exercise_version_control/README.md)
  - Work with students to get one of their projects cloned. So that they can start using git.

## Lesson Plan 2 - Lab

    - don't enable feedback pull requests on this one.
  - Talk about branching
